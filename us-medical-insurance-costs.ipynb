    "### Welcome to my Medical Portfolio Project\n",

    "Source: 'insurance.csv'\n",
    "\n",
    "insurance.csv' includes 1338 datapoints of insurance data for a group of randomly sampled individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each datapoint includes the following variables: Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, Charges\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of my analysis was to determine which variables were most impactful to insurance cost, so that an individual may know how to potentially lower it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this I utilized both averages data, but also correlation data in the form of the R-value and P-value to factor out any statistically in-signicant results, and to demonstrate which have the greatest total correlation with cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as smoker status turned out to be an outlier, I recalculated everything for non-smokers to determine how averages change with the assumption that an individual does not smoke. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code has the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read in the data as two seperate dictionaries (one with all data, and one with the smoker data removed), additionally adding a seperate binary \"parent\" nominal variable.\n",
    "* A function to determine the base average insurance charge data of the given dataset.\n",
    "* A function to calculate the average cost of insurance given a specific variable\n",
    "* A function to pull the average cost data for all variables and compare it against the base average for the dataset.\n",
    "* A function to take in any binary nominal variables and any numeric variables, and see how they are correlated to the cost\n",
    "* A function to check all valid variables and organize the data based on how significant the correlation is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lastly I called the average cost function, and the correlation function for both cases (all data and non-smokers)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### PS: The functions have been built open-ended, meaning it is possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To determine correlation between two variables outside of cost. \n",
    "    * For example, the correlation between age and BMI.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* To check the average of a value given a specific classifier:\n",
    "    * For example, we can see the average age of a parent\n",
    "    * Or the average BMI by region\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple examples of this application have also been demonstrated with the final function calls."
